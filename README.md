## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 1. This challenge was similar to my previous challenges. I had the opportunity to get more practice with margins, padding, flexbox columns and media queries while working on this challenge.
 2. I aimed to use only em units for margins, padding and border-radius. I was just curious to see the results.

### Continued development
 
1. Writing semantic html.
2. Building better layouts using flexbox and grid.
